 * @brief Takes a set of optical flow vectors and extracts information such as relative velocities and surface roughness.
 *
 * A horizontal and vertical linear fit is made with the optical flow vectors, and from the fit parameters information is extracted such as relative velocities (useful for time-to-contact determination), slope angle, and surface roughness.
